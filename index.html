            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify">I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing  <strong>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)</strong> in  <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong> at the distinguished  <strong>Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics (IRPE)</strong>, <a href="https://www.caluniv.ac.in/">University of Calcutta</a>, India. 
              <p style="text-align:justify">
                I consider myself immensely fortunate to have been graced with invaluable guidance and mentorship from esteemed researchers over the years. Currently, I am working as an intern in <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> under the supervison of <a href="https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html">Prof. Min Xu</a>, where my work revolves around the visualization and analysis of RNAscopeâ„¢ images.
	        During a prior period, I dedicated my summer semester break at <strong>Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India</strong>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/~sankar/">Prof. Sankar Kumar Pal</a> (recepient of <strong>Padma Shri</strong> in <strong>Science and Engineering, 2013</strong>) on conceptualization and implementation of a Multiclass Deep Sort, coupled with the development of a Granulated Region-Based CNN. These innovative frameworks were meticulously designed to advance the domain of object tracking.
                I have also worked extensively with <a href="https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/RPE/Anisha-Halder-Roy.pdf">Prof. Anisha Halder Roy</a> on various Human-Computer Interface tasks. Additionally, I have gained experience as an intern at <strong>C-DAC, Pune</strong>, working under the guidance of Dr. Anil Kumar Gupta. Further, during the Winter semester break, I was priviledged to work at Applied AI Research Lab, USD under the guidance of Prof. KC Santosh.

	      <p style="text-align:justify">
	       Outside the realm of academia, I have cultivated proficiency in the <a href="data/Fine Arts.pdf">Fine Arts</a>, honing my skills as a competent photographer and adept table tennis player. </p>
